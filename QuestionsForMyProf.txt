-Is there a way to send validation errors as the server's response?
    Currently, they just act as break statements trigged by bad input.
-Is there a term for functions that act like state machines?
 They are recursive yet based on the states of what is returned the functions they call,
 they call different sub functions?
-My next little task is to finish CRUD with the med_bottles.
 Can I just jump into React-Native after that step, or do you recommend something else.
